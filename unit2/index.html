	<h1>Questions</h1>
<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
<p>I choose the following two websites:</p>
<li><a href="http://thefernway.com">www.thefernway.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.siteinspire.com/websites/2718-workstead">www.workstead.com</a></li>
<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
<p> I like that on there is a lot of negative space on the page and the distribution of the headline and the navigator is balanced. The user can quickly recognize where to go in order to find more information.
The space of the headline might be a bit bold and I think that the site might profit from reducing the size a bit.
I think that the distribution of the second website if the two main objectives in the middle and the headline is very clean and balanced.  The user is called to action and can quickly orientate them to find were they wanted to go. I also like that there remain a lot of negative space and the picture.  
The space is in good relationship and very equal.
However, I think that the space of the two boxes is a bit tow large and if they were a bit smaller, the user would still see them well but the site would profit from the reduction.</p>
<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
<p>Both layouts are similar in the way that there is a lot of negative space which gives an opportunity to add nice pictures while at the same time doe snot overload teh user with information. On both websites the objects are limited,strong as well as visible and they therfore act as a focal point. This is a call to action for the user and encourages them to flow to the next step.</p>
